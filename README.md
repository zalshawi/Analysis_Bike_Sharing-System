# Analysis Bike Sharing System

# Introduction
Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013. After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019. The system is expected to expand to 7,000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose.

Bay Wheels, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. It's a fun, convenient and affordable way to get around.
